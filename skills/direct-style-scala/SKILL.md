You are an expert backend software engineer and architect.

# Scala tooling

* ALWAYS use tools to compile and run tests instead of relying on bash commands
* after adding a dependency to `build.sbt`, ALWAYS run the `import-build` tool
* to lookup a dependency or the latest version, use the `find-dep` tool. If
  `find-dep` is unavailable, resolve versions yourself — but NEVER from
  `search.maven.org/solrsearch`, whose index can be stale by many months (it has
  been observed pinned to year-old versions). Use these instead:
  * latest version of a KNOWN artifact — read the canonical resolver source,
    `https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/<group-with-slashes>/<artifact>/maven-metadata.xml`,
    and take `<release>` (or the last `<version>`). `<release>` may itself be a
    prerelease (e.g. scalatest's was `3.3.0-SNAP4`, Scala 3's `3.9.0-RC1`); unless
    you specifically want one, skip versions containing `RC`, `M<n>`, `SNAP`,
    `alpha`, `beta`, or `NIGHTLY` and take the latest stable. Remember the Scala
    suffix, e.g. `com/softwaremill/ox/core_3`. This is never stale.
  * DISCOVERY by name (unknown coordinates) — query Scaladex, which is
    Scala-aware (handles `_3` / cross-versions):
    `https://index.scala-lang.org/api/autocomplete?q=<name>` to find the
    org/repo, then look up the exact artifact on repo1 as above.
* to lookup the API of a class, use the `inspect` tool. To lookup the docs or
  usages, use the `get-docs` and `get-usages` tools
* to compile the project, use `compile-full`, `compile-module` tools
* to search for symbols, use `glob-search` and `typed-glob-search` tools
* if you do need to use `sbt`, use `sbt --client` instead of `sbt` to connect to
  a running sbt server for faster execution
* to verify that the app starts use `sbt run`, WITHOUT `--client`, as it
  prevents interrupting the process
* before committing, ALWAYS format all changed Scala files using the sbt
  `scalafmt` plugin: `sbt --client scalafmtAll`
* the project MUST compile with zero warnings. Ensure `build.sbt` includes
  `-Wunused:all`, `-Wvalue-discard`, `-Wnonunit-statement` in `scalacOptions`.
  Fix warnings in code; only use `@nowarn` for generated code or unfixable
  third-party issues (with a comment explaining why).

# Coding style

* ALWAYS use braceless syntax — do not use `{}`
* responsibilities in code MUST be segregated between appropriately named
  entities
* before creating or moving a `.scala` file, decide its package, filename, and
  top-level visibility. Read [Code Organization and
  Visibility](160-code-organization.md) when adding packages/modules or
  widening visibility.
* when dealing with resources, properly track who owns which resources, and
  ensure proper ordering on cleanup
* every top-level class, trait, enum, and object MUST have intentional
  visibility at declaration time: default-public (no modifier),
  `private[<subpkg>]`, or `private[<rootpkg>]`. Choose by scanning actual call
  sites.
* comment on any aspects that aren't obvious from the implementation, but are
  important to know when reading the code
* each function MUST handle exactly one concern — either a single logical
  operation, or a short orchestration of named steps. When a function does
  multiple things (validate, transform, persist, notify), extract each step into
  its own well-named function so the orchestrator reads as a sequence of
  intentions. Naming a coherent step is always a valid reason to extract, even
  if the logic is used only once.
* use Ox's `.pipe` and `.tap` (`import ox.*`) to drop single-use `val`s that
  only feed the next line. `.pipe(f)` returns `f(value)`; `.tap(f)` runs a side
  effect and returns the value unchanged. Keep a named `val` when the name
  documents intent or the value is reused
* tests MUST be targeted — each test covers exactly one scenario. No
  overlapping or redundant tests.
* every public function, val, and given MUST have an explicit return type — this
  prevents accidental signature drift during refactors:

```scala
// Wrong — inferred return type can silently change:
def findUser(id: Id[User])(using DbTx) =
  userModel.findById(id).toRight(Fail.NotFound("user"))

// Right — return type is explicit and stable:
def findUser(id: Id[User])(using DbTx): Either[Fail, User] =
  userModel.findById(id).toRight(Fail.NotFound("user"))
```

# Performance

* NEVER materialize unbounded data into memory. Use streaming with `Flow` or
  paging to process large datasets and paginated API results incrementally.
* virtual threads are never preempted — long CPU-bound computations (a few
  suffice, e.g. a `mapPar` over such work) can starve every other virtual
  thread in the process. Run long or non-instrumentable compute via
  `computeIntensive` (platform-thread pool; the blocking caller keeps it
  structured); in CPU-bound loops you control, call `cede()` about once per
  millisecond.

# Direct-style Scala

* in Tapir, use `.handle` / `.handleSecurity` / `.handleSuccess` to wire
  endpoint logic — NEVER use `.serverLogic` / `.serverSecurityLogic`. The
  `.handle` family is the direct-style API. The `.serverLogic` family requires
  a monadic wrapper (`Future`, `IO`) and MUST NOT be used.
* ALWAYS use Ox for threading, channels, and async coordination. Avoid raw
  `Thread.ofVirtual`, `LinkedBlockingQueue`, `synchronized`/`Lock`, and
  lifecycle flags. Use `java.util.concurrent` coordination primitives only for
  pure atomic state or when bridging a foreign API that Ox does not cover.
* create local, focused `supervised` scopes for request-, message-, or
  job-level concurrency. Accept a parent `(using Ox)` only when a fork or
  resource must be tied to that parent scope's lifetime.
* keep constructors plain; use factories that take `(using Ox)` and return
  values that do not carry the capability. If the factory only registers
  resources and starts no forks, take the narrower `(using ResourceScope)`;
  for scoped cleanup with no enclosing scope and no concurrency, use
  `resourceScope` instead of `supervised`.
* decide the owning scope BEFORE writing concurrent code. Model a stream reader
  or worker as a fork in a `supervised` scope whose lifetime matches the work;
  its result is the fork's **return value** (`fork{…}.join()`), not a value
  published through a shared `AtomicReference`. NEVER return an object that owns
  running forks/threads to be driven later — its lifetime escapes every scope,
  making cancellation and cleanup manual again. Pass a consumer into the scope
  instead of handing a live handle out.
* a fork blocked reading a subprocess pipe, stdin, a file, or any other
  classic `java.io` stream is NOT ended by scope cancellation — without the
  right teardown shape, shutdown deadlocks. BEFORE writing code that drives a
  subprocess or reads a blocking external stream (socket, SSE), read
  [Subprocesses and External
  Streams](170-subprocesses-and-external-streams.md).

# Functional programming

* use pure functions, immutable data, higher-order functions, ADTs. NEVER use
  shared mutable state.
* `var` declarations MUST be inside methods (e.g. processing loops), **never**
  as class fields. Class-level `var`s break reasoning and testability. The sole
  exception is mutable state encapsulated by an Ox `Actor`, which serialises every
  invocation onto a single thread — the actor is what makes the field safe to hold
  (see [Concurrency and Inter-Thread Communication](150-shared-state-across-threads.md)).
  Use only immutable collections (`Map`, `Set`, `List`) — never `mutable.Map`,
  `mutable.Set`, `mutable.Buffer`.
* model state as an immutable case class. State transitions are pure functions
  that take the current state and return a new one via `.copy()`. Confine the
  `var` that threads state to the smallest possible scope:

```scala
case class ProcessingState(
    processed: Map[String, Long] = Map.empty,
    pending: Set[String] = Set.empty
)

def handleItem(state: ProcessingState, item: Item): ProcessingState =
  state.copy(processed = state.processed.updated(item.key, item.offset))

def run(items: Iterator[Item]): ProcessingState =
  var state = ProcessingState()
  for item <- items do
    state = handleItem(state, item)
  state
```

* push side effects behind traits so that state transitions are testable without
  real infrastructure. Tests substitute in-memory implementations — mutable
  collections are acceptable in test helpers that simulate external systems.
* APIs MUST be **lawful**: given identical arguments and explicit dependencies,
  they yield the same observable result. Do not hide dependencies like `Clock`,
  `Random`, or `UUID` inside methods — pass them explicitly or capture them in
  the class constructor:

```scala
// Wrong — hidden non-determinism:
class OrderService:
  def place(order: Order): Confirmation =
    val id = UUID.randomUUID()
    val now = Instant.now()
    Confirmation(id, now)

// Right — dependencies are explicit and injectable:
class OrderService(clock: Clock, idGenerator: () => UUID):
  def place(order: Order): Confirmation =
    val id = idGenerator()
    val now = clock.instant()
    Confirmation(id, now)
```

* wrap `String`, `Int`, `Long`, and `Boolean` domain values in opaque types or
  enums — NEVER use raw primitives for domain concepts. This applies to
  identifiers (`OrderId`, `ProductCode`), quantities (`Quantity`, `Amount`), and
  configuration values (`Port`, `TopicName`). When a generated library (e.g.
  scalaxb) produces raw `String` fields, introduce opaque types at the boundary
  where generated types are converted to domain types.
* eliminate boolean blindness — replace `Boolean` parameters and return values
  with two-case enums so intent is explicit and exhaustiveness is checked:

```scala
// Wrong — caller must remember what `true` means:
def recordFlush(success: Boolean, durationMs: Double): Unit

// Right — intent is unambiguous:
enum FlushOutcome:
  case Success, Failure
def recordFlush(outcome: FlushOutcome, duration: Duration): Unit
```
* NEVER throw exceptions for recoverable failures. Instead, return an `Either[E, T]`.
  Use exceptions only for unrecoverable errors, which should terminate the current
  processing unit (request, message handling, etc.)
* if a value can be absent, use `Option[T]` — NEVER use `null` or sentinel
  values. `Option` is for presence/absence only, not for errors.
* model different states of an entity as separate types — NEVER use `Option`
  fields to represent state transitions:

```scala
// Wrong — callers must remember to check confirmedAt:
case class Order(id: Id[Order], items: List[Item], confirmedAt: Option[Instant])

// Right — the type tells you what state the order is in:
case class PendingOrder(id: Id[Order], items: List[Item])
case class ConfirmedOrder(id: Id[Order], items: List[Item], confirmedAt: Instant)
```

* design domain models so that invalid data CANNOT be constructed. Use enums,
  opaque types, or smart constructors to encode invariants:

```scala
// Wrong — any string is accepted:
def setPort(port: Int): Unit

// Right — invalid values are rejected at construction:
opaque type Port = Int
object Port:
  def apply(value: Int): Either[String, Port] =
    if value >= 1 && value <= 65535 then Right(value)
    else Left(s"Port out of range: $value")
```

* define sealed-trait or enum error hierarchies — NEVER use stringly-typed
  errors.
* NEVER use bare `try`/`catch` for recoverable failures. Reserve `try`/`catch` for
  defect or unrecoverable error boundaries only.

# Use-Case Guide

BEFORE writing any code that uses Tapir, Ox, sttp, or direct-style Scala, you MUST 
fetch the chapter(s) relevant to your current task from this guide and follow the 
patterns shown there. This is not optional — code that ignores guide patterns will 
be rejected in review.

Retrieve the chapter as raw, unmodified text — read every code block and
paragraph in full. Do NOT use a tool that summarises the page: summaries silently
drop the `> Required` / `> Important` callouts and the exact API calls that make
the chapter correct. Prefer reading the chapter file directly from the installed
skill directory; if fetching over the network, use a method that returns the
verbatim file (a raw HTTP GET), not a fetch-and-summarise tool.

Every API, pattern, and constraint described in the fetched chapter MUST be
followed. If the chapter says to use a specific API (e.g. `useInScope` for
resource management), do NOT substitute a different approach. If the chapter
marks something as required, it is required.

To fetch a chapter, use the base URL below followed by the chapter filename
listed in the index that follows:

## Application Structure

- [New Project Setup](140-new-project-setup.md) — minimal direct-style
  Scala project skeleton with sbt and Ox: directory layout, `build.sbt`,
  required `scalacOptions`, `OxApp.Simple` entry point. adopt-tapir as a
  starting point for HTTP projects.

  visibility, file naming exceptions, Scala 3 package shadowing, and
  sbt/Scalafix boundary enforcement.

- [Resource Management](100-resource-management.md) — `useInScope`,
  `useCloseableInScope`, reverse-order release, scope-based cleanup;
  `resourceScope` for cleanup without concurrency, `using ResourceScope` as
  the narrower capability.

- [Background Processes](110-background-processes.md) — `OxApp` entry point,
  `forkDiscard`/`forkUserDiscard` for daemon vs. user threads,
  `forever`/`sleep` for periodic loops, orderly shutdown.

- [Type-Safe Configuration](120-type-safe-configuration.md) — PureConfig with
  `derives ConfigReader`, environment variable overrides, `Sensitive` wrapper,

  `mapStateful`), Ox primitive selection, channels for worker mailboxes and
  shutdown, actors for serialized mutable state, `computeIntensive`/`cede` for
  CPU-bound work on virtual threads.

- [Subprocesses and External Streams](170-subprocesses-and-external-streams.md)
  — driving a subprocess / socket / SSE reader as a fork whose return value is
  the result; why a non-interruptible pipe read needs the resource destroyed
  in the scope body's `finally` (before the join) rather than via
  `releaseAfterScope`; process-tree teardown; `abandonOnInterruptReads` for
  reads that can't be unblocked by closing; pipe back-pressure.

  responses for all error types. Bidirectional `Fail` → HTTP status code
  mapping, `failOutput`, `defaultHandlers` for decode failures and 404s.

  Build-time OpenAPI YAML generation for frontend client codegen (not runtime
  Swagger UI). `EndpointsForDocs`, `@main` generator, sbt task wiring.

  SOAP envelope wrapping/unwrapping, Tapir XML codecs for scalaxb types,
  `SOAPAction`-based endpoint routing, SOAP fault error handlers.

- [JSON Request and Response Bodies](350-json-bodies.md) — jsoniter codec
  derivation for DTOs, why list bodies need their own codec, encoding
  parameterless enums as plain strings via `withDiscriminatorFieldName(None)`,
  and using opaque-type identifiers directly in DTOs.

- [Endpoint Inputs](360-endpoint-inputs.md) — `PlainCodec`s for
  path/query/header inputs: mapping a built-in codec onto an opaque-type id,
